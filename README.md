# naivebayesnet
A naive Bayesian network written in Java. Uses only binary random variables and inference by enumeration. Tested on a [stroke prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) by [fedesoriano](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano) from Kaggle. Code requires [Apache Commons CSV](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/) to read the dataset, which is not included here.
